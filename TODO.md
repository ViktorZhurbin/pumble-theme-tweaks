# Features list TODO

## Change tweaks toggle behavior a bit
Next to each color picker, show a badge indicating that color is different from the current Pumble theme default

If no colors stored:
- Hide Reset button
- Hide Tweaks ON/OFF checkbox


Fix:
- When theme is changed, tweaks for that team should be ON or OFF depending on that theme's saved `disabled` state. The checkbox should reflect that correctly (or be hidden).

## Save and delete presets
- Add a button to Save preset
